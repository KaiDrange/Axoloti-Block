# Axoloti-Block
Axoloti hardware synth for the Roli Blocks system

It is a 3D printed axoloti enclosure with an acrylic laser cut front panel, battery power, five potmeters and four pushbuttons. Dimensions are the same as two Roli Lightpad Blocks next to each other. Magnets in the enclosure means the Blocks snaps neatly to the Axoloti.

I normally use a CME Widi Bud in the USB Host port of the Axoloti for wireless Bluetooth midi to/from the Roli Blocks, but USB cable works as well. But note that the Widi Bud will choke on large amounts of midi data, resulting in hanging notes, etc. Three simultaneous keys with full expression works well, so the Widi Bud is OK for "simple" playing.

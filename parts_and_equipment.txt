I used:
2mm thick transparent acrylic PMMA for the panel with connections. Thicker than 2mm would probably make some of the IO hard to use. (I also used this as a mounting board for the potmeters)

PLA filament for 3D printing the case.

Five 9mm VERTICAL: B25K - 25K Linear potmeters:

M3 and M2 countersunk screws and nuts.

White acrylic paint for the engraved text on the acrylic panel (before the black spray)

Black acrylic spray paint for the acrylic panel (after painting the engraved sections white)

Black Plasti Dip rubber spray for the 3D printed case.

Five 10x10mm square neodymium magnets (three in front, one on each side)

Super-glue

A dremel to drill holes for M3 screws and notches for the magnets in the acrylic mounting board I attached the pots to.
